                                        you are surfing the Internet. Web servers (computers that "serve up" web pages)
                                        automatically identify your computer by its
                                        IP address. When visitors request pages from our Websites, our servers typically
                                        log their IP addresses.
                                        We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report

                                        and to track the use of our Website. IP addresses are considered non-personal
                                        information and may also be shared as provided above.
                                        We reserve the right to use IP addresses and any personally identifiable
